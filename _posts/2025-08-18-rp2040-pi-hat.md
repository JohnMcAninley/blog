If you’ve ever worked with a Raspberry Pi, you know that HATs (Hardware Attached on Top) are the best way to expand its capabilities. Whether you're adding sensors, motor drivers, displays, or communication interfaces, a custom Pi HAT lets you design exactly what you need.

But what if you want more processing power on the HAT itself? Enter the **RP2040**, the dual-core microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. By designing a Pi HAT with an RP2040, you can:

- Offload real-time tasks from the Raspberry Pi
- Handle fast I/O
- Even run standalone firmware when the Pi is powered off

Many projects lend themselves naturally to the use of both a computer and a microcontroller. The Raspberry Pi and RP2040 can be used together without a Pi HAT, but the use of the HAT creates a clean, compact system that minimizes wiring and cable clutter.

In this post, I'll walk you through how to design and manufacture an **RP2040-based Raspberry Pi HAT using KiCad**.

## Why Use a Raspberry Pi and an RP2040?

At first, it might seem redundant to add an RP2040 to a Raspberry Pi or vice versa as there is overlap in capabilities. The Raspberry Pi includes GPIO pins as well as low-level peripherals (e.g., SPI, UART, I2C). The RP2040 is powerful enough to host a web server (especially in a configuration like the Pico W) or connect to a touch screen display.

However, a project often has requirements that go beyond the capabilities of either system alone.

### Common use cases for an RP2040 Pi HAT:

- Fast GPIO control for stepper motors, servos, or LEDs
- Custom USB devices (e.g., HID keyboard/mouse emulation)
- Data acquisition with high-speed ADC sampling
- Adding extra UART/SPI/I2C ports for peripherals

### Why add an RP2040 to your Raspberry Pi project?

- **Real-time processing** – Handle timing-critical tasks like PWM, quadrature decoding, or precise ADC sampling.
- **Offloading I/O** – The PIO (Programmable I/O) blocks allow ultra-fast serial communication, waveform generation, and more.
- **Lower power operation** – The RP2040 can run standalone when the Raspberry Pi is off or in low-power mode.

### Why add a Raspberry Pi to an RP2040 project?

- **Computation** – For intensive processing, the Raspberry Pi's CPU is far more powerful.
- **User Interfaces** – The Raspberry Pi excels at handling displays, keyboards, and complex UI.
- **Web Applications** – Host web-based dashboards or APIs for data collected by the RP2040.

## Step 2: Adding the RP2040 to the Schematic

- ✔ 3.3V power supply (e.g., AP2112K or RT9080 LDO)
- ✔ USB Type-C or GPIO-based programming

### Oscillator

Include a **12 MHz crystal oscillator** for USB and stable peripheral timing. You can also use a Raspberry Pi GPCLK as a clock source, but this requires additional setup.

### Flash

Use **QSPI flash** to store firmware. Technically optional, but essential for most real-world applications.

### Boot and Reset

Add:
- **BOOTSEL button** (for USB mass storage mode)
- **RESET button** (for convenience)

These are especially useful during initial flashing or recovery. GPIO control of these lines from the Pi is also possible.

### Power

- The RP2040 requires **3.3V**
- It contains an internal LDO to generate **1.1V for its cores**

#### Power Sources

- **From the Pi:** Use Pi’s 3.3V pin (limited current depending on model)
- **From USB:** Use a 3.3V LDO and ensure isolation (e.g., using a p-channel MOSFET or Schottky diodes)
- **External:** Optional, if your HAT needs more power than the Pi or USB can provide

### Decoupling Capacitors

- Required on both **3.3V** and **1.1V** lines
- Place as close to the power pins as possible

## Step 2A: Communication Between RP2040 and Raspberry Pi

### 1. UART

**How to Connect:**

- RP2040 TX → Pi RX (GPIO14)
- RP2040 RX → Pi TX (GPIO15)

- ✅ Natively supported
- ✅ Great for 115200+ baud

**Limitations:**

- ✖ Fixed baud rate
- ✖ One full-duplex link

**Use Cases:**

- Debug output
- Command/control interfaces
- Sensor data streaming

- ✅ Place decoupling caps close to pins
- ✅ Use wide power traces
- ✅ Follow HAT spec for mounting holes + EEPROM

**Manufacturing Tips:**

- Use 2-layer PCBs when possible
